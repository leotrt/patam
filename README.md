PAye Ton Assistante Maternelle

This is simple app that I'm using on a daily basis to be sure to pay my son's nanny appropriately each month.

It's also an experiment for me, I built it to gain so skill on:
- Ionic React
- SwiperJs
- NgNeat's Elf state managament library in React
- react-hook-form
- Soft UI (also called Neumorphism)
